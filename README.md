# Apartmenify-App-React-Redux-Toolkit-Supabase

Apartmenify Apartmenify is a web application that allows users to reserve apartments and give them ratings after the reservation is finished. The application is built with React, Vite, Redux Toolkit, and Supabase.

Features Apartmenify has the following features:

Public dashboard: Users can reserve apartments and give them ratings after the reservation is finished. The rating system is from 1 to 5, and apartments have an average rating each. Users can also add comments after the reservation is finished. Each user can like apartments and put them into a save section for them to reserve later. Each user has their profile.

Admin dashboard: Admins can manage apartments, reservations, and users. The admin dashboard contains three routes:

Apartments: Displays all apartments along with their status (free, occupied, and reserved).

Reservations: Shows all current reservations.

Users: Displays active users that are registered.

Authentication: To enter the app as an admin or user, you have to login with your email and password through Gmail or Facebook Supabase Auth. Supabase is used for managing data and relations.
